# Presentations
Repository containing presentations of my analyses that I have given for academic conferences. 

# Publications
Publication in an academic article belongs to the journal and not to the author and therefore, I cannot make the articles publically available. However, here is a link to my profile on Google Scholar which contains links to those academic publications.
